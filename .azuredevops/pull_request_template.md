# Pull Request Template

> ⚠️ **Guidelines** (delete this section before submitting)
>
> - Keep it short and clear — the text below will become the body of the merge commit
> - **PR Title**
>   - Answer the questions: What problem does this solve? What is being changed?
>   - Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) prefixes
>     - `fix:` **PATCH** version digit bump
>     - `feat:` **MINOR** version digit bump
>     - `feat!:` or **BREAKING CHANGE** in the body: **MAJOR** version digit bump
>   - Use the imperative mood
>   - Do not end the title with a period
>   - Append `[skip ci]` to the end of the title to skip CI for non-code changes
> - Reference issues where relevant (`Fixes #1234`).
> - You **MUST** check the box `Customize merge commit message` before merging and remove the header automatically added by Azure DevOps
