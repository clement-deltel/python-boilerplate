## Development Deployment

Here are the steps to set up a development environment to run this application.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Let uv initialize the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
make init-dev
```

3. Install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

4. Fill in the `.env.template` file with your configuration.
5. Rename the file to `.env`.
6. Run the application:

```bash
make run
```

## Debug

Here useful tips to debug the project's code.

Do you want to debug using builtin VSCode debugger?

- Go to the "Run & Debug" tab
- Start a debugging session (using the project's **launch** configuration from the `.code-workspace` file)

Do you want to debug using command line tool pdb?

```bash
make debug
```

> Note: these commands are valid in the situation when you are debugging from the code, but also when you are using the `DEBUG_ENTRYPOINT` environment variable set to "true" (see [entrypoint.sh](docker/entrypoint.sh)).

## Merge Request

Every time you push some code and consequently open a merge request, do not forget to:

- Build an image of the app and scan it using [trivy](#trivy)
- Update the code statistics table in the [README.md](README.md) file using [tokei](#tokei)
- Update the dependency tree in the [README.md](README.md) file using [uv](#uv)
- If needed
  - Update the environment variables table in the [README.md](README.md) file using [csv2md](#csv2md)

## Tools

### uv

```bash
uv sync
```

Visualize the dependency tree?

```bash
uv tree --no-default-groups
```

Add a new dependency...

- for the project?

```bash
uv add <package>
```

- for **development** purposes only?

```bash
uv add --group dev <package>
```

- for **test** purposes only?

```bash
uv add --group test <package>
```

Remove a dependency...

- for the project?

```bash
uv remove <package>
```

- for **development** purposes only?

```bash
uv remove --group dev <package>
```

- for **test** purposes only?

```bash
uv remove --group test <package>
```

Export dependencies and update requirements files...

- as a **user** and for the project?

```bash
uv export --format requirements-txt --no-default-groups --no-emit-project --output-file requirements.txt
```

- as a **developer**?

```bash
uv export --format requirements-txt --group dev --group lint --no-default-groups --no-emit-project --output-file requirements-dev.txt
```

- as a **QA engineer**?

```bash
uv export --format requirements-txt --group test --no-default-groups --no-emit-project --output-file requirements-test.txt
```

### ruff

Here are useful commands to lint and format code using [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/). The source code of this tool is available [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff). Do you want to:

```

Format a single file?

```bash
ruff format path/to/file.py
```

### gitleaks

Here are useful commands to detect potential secret leaks using [gitleaks](https://gitleaks.io/). The source code of this tool is available [here](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks). Do you want to:

Scan all the commits

```

Run all the hooks on a specific file in the repository?

```bash
pre-commit run --files <path/to/file>
```

Produce hook output independent of success?

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files --verbose
```

Run a specific hook?

```bash
pre-commit run <hook-id> --all-files --verbose
```

Uninstall hooks?

```bash
