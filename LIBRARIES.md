- [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)
- [csv2md](https://github.com/lzakharov/csv2md): command line tool for converting CSV files into Markdown tables.
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): static typing for Python.
- [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry): Python packaging and dependency management made easy.
- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit): framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.
- [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff): extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.
- [snakeviz](https://github.com/jiffyclub/snakeviz): in-browser Python profile viewer.

And the corresponding Visual Studio Code extension for some of them:

## Coding practices

Make Python faster:

- use built-in functions
- use generators
- use concurrency

## Future enhancements

Here is a list of tools that could be interesting and further enhance the stack:

- [pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow): Python imaging library.
- [pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic): data validation using Python type hints.
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv): extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust.
- [uv-pre-commit](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv-pre-commit)

And specifically makes Python faster:

- [cython](https://github.com/cython/cython): most widely used Python to C compiler.
- [pypy](https://github.com/pypy/pypy): very fast and compliant implementation of the Python language.
