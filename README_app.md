## Requirements

The core requirements are:

- Python

Some extra utilities are:

- [docker](https://github.com/docker) - software platform that allows to build, test, and deploy applications quickly, packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) - Python package and project manager. `Rust`

## Dependencies

The application dependencies are managed with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv). You can find more information on how to install it on your system [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation). It is recommended to install and use it, even still requirements files are available and can be used.

## Configuration

The application configuration can be loaded as a set of environment variables in the Docker image. A file mounted on /app/.env can also override those values for testing purposes.

List of available environment variables:

| Variable           | Type | Sensitive | Default     | Condition | Example             | Description                                                        |

## Logs

The application logs are based on the Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html) module, following the [CloudEvents specification](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/main/cloudevents/spec.md). Here are the different fields:

- **specversion**
- **type**
- **source**
- **subject**
- **id**
- **time**
- **environment**: application environment
- **level**: log level
- **datacontenttype**
- **data**
  - **user_id**: user running the application
  - **table**: database table name
  - **record**: database record being processed
  - **wait**: wait time value expressed in seconds

## Quick Start

There are four ways to run this application:

2. Let uv initialize the Python virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
make init
```

If using pip, you have to manually:

- Create a Python virtual environment.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Install the application dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/requirements.txt
```

3. Fill in the `.env.schema` file with your configuration.
4. Rename the file to `.env`.
5. Run the application:

```bash
make run
```

### Docker

1. Clone the repository.
2. Build the Docker image:

```bash
make build-image
```

3. Fill in the `.env.schema` file with your configuration.
4. Rename the file to `.env`.
5. Run the application:

- Run a container:

```bash
make run-container
```

- Create and then run a container:

```bash
# Create
make create-container
# Start
docker start app-name
# or (if you need to attach to the application process)
docker start app-name --attach
```

6. Remove container after execution (if `--rm` option was not used):

```bash
docker rm app-name
```

### Docker Compose

1. Clone this repository.
2. Fill in the `.env.schema` file with your configuration.
3. Rename the file to `.env`.
4. Run the application:

- Run a container:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose up --abort-on-container-exit
docker compose down -v
```

- Create and then run a container:

```bash
cd docker
docker compose create
docker compose start
docker logs app-name
docker compose down -v
```

> **Note**: specifically with Docker Compose, if any of your environment variables contains a "\$" character, make sure to put the value between double quotes and escape the "$" with a "\\" character.
